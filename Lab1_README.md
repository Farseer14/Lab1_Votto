### Joe Votto's Lab 1 READ ME

Code has been tested for 3 and 8 bits by Dr. Neebel.

Waveform outlines the twos compliment of each portion of the cuircuit as predicted by the truth table. Green space represents a 1 where a green line is representitive of a 0.

Both the first and final schematic (circuit diagram appear to be the same.


In and of itself Debugging was relatively simple. The hard part was understanding what the fragments of code did and not necessarily how to reorder them afterwards. Granted I spent a solid 30 minutes on discerning the syntax for the Eight_BitOUT segment but otherwise not an overly complex code to write.

As mentioned at the top of the READ ME both the 3-bit and 8-bit circuits were show to have been successful.
